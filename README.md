{First Portfolio} (Homework 2)
This is a mockup of a portfolio page. 
The page features a header, a space occupied by an image, an about me section, a work section, and lastly, a contact me section at the bottom.
The banner at the top includes my name and has navigation links to the corresponding sections of the site.
The about me will contain only filler text for now.
The Work section contains a grid with images representing different projects.
The sections within the work section enlarge when they are active or in focus. The fist one is perpetually enlarged.
The footer or Contact Me section, contains links to my contact information which are now placeholders for the most part.
